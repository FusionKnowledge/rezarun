      <h2>Measuring the World with His Feet: The Daring Journey of Reza Baluchi</h2>

      <p>In a world of rapid change and advanced technology, tales of adventure and extreme challenges often seem like
        the stuff of movies or novels. Yet one man—Reza Baluchi, an Iranian-born adventurer now living in the United
        States—is proving through sheer willpower and footsteps that dreams don’t require wealth or fame, just
        persistence and a beating heart.</p>

      <p>He once attempted to cross the Atlantic Ocean from Florida to Bermuda inside a human-powered bubble. Now,
        wearing Taiwan-customized athletic gear with the phrase "Run with Reza," he is running around the island of
        Taiwan in 20 days with barely any sleep. And after this, his next mission: to cross the world in that same
        bubble—one stride, one wave at a time.</p>

      <h3>1. Escaping Oppression: From Iran to the United States</h3>
      <p>Reza Baluchi's story didn’t begin with applause and blessings. Born in Iran, he grew up under a society marked
        by political and religious repression. As a young man, he was a professional cyclist, even representing Iran in
        competitions. However, disillusioned with the government's suppression of freedom, he eventually chose to flee.
      </p>
      <p>He undertook a harrowing journey across multiple borders—enduring deserts, hunger, and imprisonment—before
        finally gaining asylum in Germany and later moving to the United States. Rather than quietly settling into a new
        life, Reza transformed his newfound freedom into a series of audacious feats aimed at promoting peace, charity,
        and human potential.</p>

      <h3>2. The Bubble Dream: Crossing the Atlantic in a Hamster Wheel</h3>
      <p>Reza is best known for his “Hydro Pod” adventures—his self-built, human-powered floating device resembling a
        giant bubble. The structure allowed him to “run” on water, essentially like a floating hamster wheel.</p>
      <p>In 2014, he first launched from Florida aiming to reach Bermuda, but was intercepted by the U.S. Coast Guard
        due to weather conditions and lack of safety equipment. Undeterred, Reza attempted the feat multiple times in
        the following years. In 2021, he made headlines again with another bubble voyage that was ultimately called off
        due to storms and mechanical issues.</p>
      <p>Although he never completed the Bermuda run, each attempt captured public attention. For Reza, these were not
        failures but powerful acts of performance—living metaphors that challenged our understanding of what’s possible.
      </p>

      <h3>3. A New Era: 20 Days Around Taiwan, Now Streaming Live with GPS Tracking</h3>
      <p>In the summer of 2025, Reza arrived in Taiwan to embark on his latest ultra-endurance mission—completing a full
        1,400 km loop around the island in just 20 days, with less than three hours of sleep per night. But this time,
        it’s not just about physical endurance—it’s also a tech-powered experience that invites the world to run with
        him in real time.</p>

      <h4>🔴 "Live on the Run" — Real-Time GPS Tracking + Global Livestreaming</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Real-time GPS satellite tracking:</strong> Fans can view Reza’s exact location and route
          progression via a dedicated website or mobile app</li>
        <li>⏱<strong>Live performance data:</strong> Including pace, total distance, weather conditions, and rest
          points</li>
        <li><strong>Daily livestream check-ins:</strong> Reza will go live each day to interact with fans, share
          stories, describe physical challenges, and reflect on the journey</li>
        <li><strong>Integrated social media broadcast:</strong> Simultaneous streaming on YouTube, Facebook, and
          Instagram for maximum reach and engagement</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This feature transforms the event from a solo endurance test into a global participatory adventure. Reza is no
        longer just running alone—he’s running with the eyes and support of the world behind him.</p>

      <blockquote>Reza: “I want people to know I’m really out here, step by step. They can be part of it, anytime,
        anywhere.”</blockquote>

      <p>The GPS system also enables local residents in Taiwan to track his progress and meet him as he passes through
        their towns, often bringing him food, drinks, or simply words of encouragement. The whole island becomes part of
        the journey.</p>

      <h4>✅ Marketing Value of "Live on the Run"</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>🔹 Combines sports technology with interactive social streaming, creating Asia’s first reality-style
          endurance running adventure</li>
        <li>🔹 Unlocks brand sponsorship opportunities, including live logo placements on gear and stream overlays</li>
        <li>🔹 Boosts international media attention and public visibility, paving the way for Reza’s upcoming global
          bubble expedition</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Reza’s Independence and Taiwan Gear</h3>
      <p>In the summer of 2025, Reza arrived in Taiwan for his latest test of endurance. His goal: to run a full lap
        around the island—approximately 1,400 kilometers—in 20 days, sleeping less than three hours per night and
        resting only along the roadside.</p>
      <p>To mark the event, he commissioned a custom set of athletic wear designed specifically for the challenge. The
        outfit includes shorts, shirts, and windbreakers featuring “Run with Reza” logos, a route map of Taiwan, and key
        metrics like “1400km Taiwan Loop.”</p>
      <p>What makes this mission even more extraordinary is his independence. Reza has no crew, no support van, and no
        corporate sponsor. His rest stops, filming, and meals are all self-managed—or offered by friendly locals. He
        views this Taiwan run as training, exposure, and a spiritual preparation for his next mega-dream: the bubble
        journey around the world.</p>

      <p>These design elements help enhance public recognition and storytelling impact. Reza hopes the visibility from
        this event will amplify his mission and attract global support for his next phase.</p>

      <h3>4. Next: The "Around the World in a Bubble" Mission</h3>
      <p>After completing his Taiwan run, Reza’s ultimate goal is to circle the globe in his bubble. This may sound
        crazy—but it's exactly this level of audacity that keeps drawing attention and admiration to his work.</p>

      <h4>■ Global Bubble Voyage Plan</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Form:</strong> Floating on oceans in a human-powered Hydro Pod</li>
        <li><strong>Proposed Route:</strong> Americas → Europe → Africa → Asia, crossing both the Atlantic and
          Pacific</li>
        <li><strong>Time Estimate:</strong> Likely to span several years, depending on weather and maritime laws</li>
        <li><strong>Key Technical Needs:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Bubble reinforced for waves, impact resistance, and stability</li>
            <li>Must be equipped with GPS, satellite communication, and renewable power</li>
            <li>Food, water, and emergency systems must be self-contained</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <blockquote>“I’m not doing this for myself. I’m doing it for those who can’t chase their dreams. I want to show
        that with determination, even the wildest dreams can come true.”</blockquote>

      <h3>5. Belief Beyond the Finish Line</h3>
      <p>Reza Baluchi isn’t a thrill-seeker chasing headlines. Each of his challenges is rooted in humanitarian goals
        and symbolic messages. He has fundraised for refugees, promoted peace, and advocated for children affected by
        war.</p>

      <blockquote>“My legs are how I speak to the world. When you keep moving forward, the world opens up.”</blockquote>

      <p>That belief has earned him both fans and respect. He's not just a runner—he’s a messenger, an artist in motion,
        and a defiant survivor of systems that tried to silence him.</p>

      <h3>6. His Connection to Taiwan</h3>
      <p>Reza’s choice to run in Taiwan wasn’t random. He was drawn to the island’s dynamic terrain, warm people, and
        openness to bold ideas. He’s been touched by the hospitality—receiving free meals, words of encouragement, and
        even resting spots offered by strangers.</p>
      <p>He interacts with locals using a mix of basic Chinese, English, and a universal smile. His goal is to leave not
        just a footprint around the island—but a message of unity and shared hope.</p>

      <h3>7. Conclusion: Writing the Story No One Else Dared</h3>
      <p>Reza Baluchi is not just an endurance athlete. He’s a spiritual traveler whose journey crosses oceans, islands,
        and ideological borders. He doesn’t race to win—but to prove that belief, freedom, and resilience are stronger
        than any obstacle.</p>
      <p>From escaping Iran, to drifting in a bubble on the Atlantic, to running sleepless through Taiwan, and dreaming
        of circling the Earth—Reza challenges the limits of body and mind while inspiring us to ask: what’s truly
        impossible?</p>
      <p>When people question the gap between dream and reality, perhaps we should remember Reza’s ever-moving feet—on
        land, sea, and in solitude—pushing forward toward a light that no one else dared chase.</p>

      <h1>用雙腳丈量世界的夢想者：Reza Baluchi的瘋狂挑戰之路</h1>
      <p>在這個快速變動、科技日新月異的時代，人們總以為冒險與極限挑戰的故事，只會存在於電影與小說之中。然而，有一位來自伊朗、定居美國的冒險家——Reza
        Baluchi，用行動向世界證明：夢想可以不靠資源、不靠名聲，只靠堅持與一雙腳，就能一步一步推進世界的邊界。</p>
      <p>他曾駕著泡泡漂浮器從美國佛羅里達出發，試圖橫渡大西洋前往百慕達群島。如今，他正穿著印有「Run with
        Reza」標誌的台灣定製運動服，挑戰20天環島一周、幾乎無眠的壯舉，並計畫在此之後，以泡泡裝置跨越全球，寫下人類體能與意志的傳奇篇章。</p>
      <h3>一、逃離壓迫的起點：從伊朗到美國</h3>
      <p>Reza Baluchi的故事，並非一開始就充滿掌聲與祝福。他出生於伊朗，在政治與宗教壓力交錯的社會環境中成長。年輕時他是一名職業自行車選手，甚至代表伊朗參加比賽。然而，因不滿政府對自由的打壓，他最終選擇逃亡。</p>
      <p>
        為了追求自由，他冒險偷渡穿越多國邊境，歷經沙漠、飢餓與監禁，最終在德國獲得難民身分，再轉赴美國，展開新的人生。他並沒有選擇隱姓埋名過平凡生活，而是將自由的價值與對和平的理念轉化為一項項驚世壯舉，藉由運動宣揚和平、慈善與人道精神。
      </p>
      <h3>二、泡泡裡的壯舉：橫渡大西洋的瘋狂夢想</h3>
      <p>Reza最廣為人知的冒險，就是他親手打造的「Hydro Pod」（俗稱泡泡）漂浮裝置。他站在一個大型透明塑膠泡泡內，內部結構設計為靠著奔跑帶動推進的浮具。簡單說，就是用「水上倉鼠輪」穿越海洋。</p>
      <p>
        2014年，他首次從佛羅里達出發，試圖前往百慕達，但因裝備不全與天氣惡劣，被美國海岸防衛隊強制攔截。儘管歷經挫敗，Reza並未放棄。之後幾年內他多次重返海上，最終在2021年，他再次試圖橫渡百慕達三角，結果仍因風暴與技術問題而中止行程。
      </p>
      <p>這些嘗試雖然都未能完成目標，但每一次都讓他在媒體與網路世界中聲名大噪。他的冒險不只是自我挑戰，更是行動藝術，傳遞著人類可以超越現實限制的信念。</p>
      <h3>三、現在進行式：20天無眠跑遍台灣，開啟即時直播新紀元</h3>
      <p>2025年夏季，Reza來到了台灣，展開他最新的極限挑戰——在20天內以超低睡眠（每天少於3小時）完成全長約1400公里的環台奔跑壯舉。但與以往不同的是，這次不只是體能上的挑戰，更是一場科技與意志力結合的跨時代活動。
      </p>
      <h3>🔴 GPS即時追蹤 + 線上直播：「Live on the Run」計畫上線！</h3>
      <p>為了讓全球粉絲與媒體能即時關注這趟壯舉，他首度引入了「Live on the Run」技術平台，整合下列功能：</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>全程GPS衛星定位系統：</strong> 民眾可透過專屬網站或App即時查看Reza目前所在位置與移動軌跡</li>
        <li><strong>即時動態更新：</strong> 包含配速、里程、氣溫、補給點資訊</li>
        <li><strong>直播互動介面：</strong> 每日開啟一段直播時段，讓Reza直接與粉絲互動、分享身體狀況、路邊趣事或心路歷程</li>
        <li><strong>社群整合：</strong> 可於 YouTube、Facebook、Instagram 進行同步播送，吸引更多國際關注</li>
      </ul>
      <p>這不僅大幅提高了活動的透明度與參與感，也讓Reza的理念能夠更即時地觸及世界各地的觀眾。他不再是孤獨在路上的旅人，而是一位帶著千萬雙眼睛的行動者。</p>
      <blockquote>Reza：「我想讓人們知道，我每一步都真實存在，他們可以隨時加入這趟旅程。」</blockquote>
      <p>這項技術也讓台灣民眾更容易在沿線迎接Reza，許多人在GPS上看到他即將經過自家社區時，主動準備水、食物與加油打氣，形成一場島嶼規模的共同參與式冒險。</p>
      <ul>
        <li>結合智慧運動科技與社群直播互動，打造亞洲首次實境極限跑步冒險節目</li>
        <li>吸引品牌贊助機會：可於直播畫面露出品牌標誌與Reza所穿裝備</li>
        <li>提升國際媒體關注度與公益能見度，有助於為後續泡泡環球之旅鋪路</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Reza 2025 台灣環島挑戰與專屬裝備</h3>
      <p>2025年夏季，Reza來到了台灣。他的計畫，是在20天內跑完台灣環島一圈（約1400公里），幾乎每天只睡不到3小時，沿路靠街邊休息與能量補給持續前進。</p>
      <p>為這次挑戰，他特別製作了一套專屬服裝與運動裝備，包括短褲、排汗衫、防風外套等，全部印有「Run with Reza」、「台灣一圈接力 1400km」等圖樣，背後並附上台灣地圖與行經縣市標示，象徵這趟意志之旅。</p>
      <p>他沒有隨行團隊，沒有贊助車，沿路休息、拍攝與補給全靠當地熱情民眾與他自己隨身攜帶的簡單物資。他將這趟挑戰視為訓練與媒體曝光的起點，準備迎接更浩大的「泡泡環球壯舉」。</p>

      <p>這樣的視覺設計不僅有助於民眾辨識，也有宣傳意義。他期望透過「行走台灣」的過程與媒體曝光，進一步讓世界看見他的理念與下一步冒險計畫。</p>
      <h3>四、下一站：泡泡環球壯舉</h3>
      <p>完成台灣環島挑戰後，Reza的最終夢想是：「用Hydro Pod環繞世界」。這聽起來近乎瘋狂——但正是這股近乎不可能的夢，讓他持續受到關注與鼓舞。</p>

      <h4>■ 環球泡泡計畫概述：</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>形式：</strong> 穿著強化泡泡裝置，依循海流與奔跑前進</li>
        <li><strong>預期路線：</strong> 美洲 → 歐洲 → 非洲 → 亞洲，跨越太平洋與大西洋</li>
        <li><strong>時間預估：</strong> 可能歷時數年，須根據氣候與國際水域規範調整</li>
        <li><strong>技術挑戰：</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>泡泡裝置需強化防風浪、防撞擊與自動定位</li>
            <li>裝備內須有 GPS、衛星通訊與能源回收系統</li>
            <li>食物、水、緊急求救設備須完善</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <blockquote>Reza：「我不是為了自己，而是為了那些無法追夢的人。我想證明：只要有決心，再瘋狂的夢都可以實現。」</blockquote>

      <h3>五、挑戰者背後的信念</h3>
      <p>Reza並不是尋求名利的冒險家。他的每一步都帶有強烈的社會目的與精神象徵。他曾在挑戰中為難民募款、為戰火地區的兒童發聲、為和平奔跑。</p>
      <p>他深信體能是與世界連結的語言。他說過：</p>
      <blockquote>「我的雙腳是我與世界對話的工具。當你不斷往前跑時，世界也會向你敞開。」</blockquote>
      <p>這樣的信念讓他贏得眾多支持者，也讓他的挑戰多了份溫暖與深度。他是一個旅人、藝術家、活動家、也是一位不屈的生命實踐者。</p>

      <h3>六、對台灣的情感</h3>
      <p>Reza選擇台灣作為這次挑戰地點，不僅因為地形多樣、挑戰性高，也因為他對台灣的文化氛圍與人民友善印象深刻。</p>
      <p>在社群媒體與街頭互動中，他用簡單的中文、英文與微笑，與沿途支持者交流。他在路上收到便當、飲水與鼓勵話語，這些都讓他更堅信：</p>
      <blockquote>「這趟旅程不只是我的，也是台灣人民的。」</blockquote>

      <h3>七、結語：以腳為筆，寫下無人敢想的故事</h3>
      <p>Reza Baluchi是一位極限挑戰者，也是一位靈魂旅人。他的旅程橫跨大洋、島嶼與制度的邊界，不為戰勝，而是為了實踐一種信念：夢想不是屬於特權階層，它屬於每一個勇敢踏出第一步的人。</p>
      <p>從伊朗逃亡，到百慕達泡泡漂流，從台灣無眠環島，到未來環球計畫，他一次次跨越人類的身心極限，也喚醒世人對「自由」、「勇氣」與「人性韌性」的深刻思考。</p>
      <p>當人們再次質疑夢想與現實之間的距離時，或許我們可以回想起Reza那雙不斷前進的雙腳——在陸地、在海洋、在風浪與孤獨之中，持續奔向那道看似遙不可及的光。</p>
